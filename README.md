# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./Project%20Requirements/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## üåç Overview

This component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. üò´ So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

You can see a couple of other little, cutie builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-qr) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-3-column-preview-card) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-single-price-grid) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-order-summary).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS and a tiny bit of vanilla JavaScript. No dependencies! ü•≥ I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://reliable-cupcake-1661bb.netlify.app/).

## ü§î Reflection

In the [last Frontend Mentor build](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-stats-preview) I did, the brief required two different images to be rendered depending on whether the component was being viewed on a desktop or mobile screen. I tried to use [picture and source elements in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture), but I didn't quite get it to work as intended.

This component also required multiple images to be rendered depending on the view, and again, I couldn't get the html to work the way I needed it to. With this build, though, I decided to make a workaround using vanilla JavaScript to check the screensize and then render the image for either the mobile or desktop view.

After trying to use JavaScript to render the images conditionally, which sort of worked as I had it, I got some feedback from someone in the Frontend Mentor community (thanks!!) and managed to get the images to display based on whether the mobile or desktop view CSS is being rendered.

This was a learning experience, for sure!

## üëÄ Demo & Live Version

Check out the live version of this component [here](https://reliable-cupcake-1661bb.netlify.app/).

And here's a little look at how the desktop version of the component compares with the design from the brief.
